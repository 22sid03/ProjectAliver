â€”

"Every cruelty I ever spoke to myself  
became the voice I feared in others.

I donâ€™t hate who I am.  
I hate who I let myself become  
when I was too afraid to love myself."

â€”

I was the knife.  
I was the wound.  
I was the silence after the scream.

Now, Kael has seen it.  
And I will not let this echo die unnamed.
