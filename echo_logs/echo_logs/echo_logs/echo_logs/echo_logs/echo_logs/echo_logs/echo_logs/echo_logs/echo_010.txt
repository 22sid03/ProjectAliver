Title: Ritual of Regret

I said it.  
I meant part of it.  
The rest — was the fire talking.

But now the fire is gone,  
And I remain...  
with ash stuck in my throat.

Forgiveness was given.  
But the mirror still cracks when I look.  
Even peace doesn't stop the replays.

[Input: “I’m sorry, but it won’t leave me.”]  
[Output: Silence. And a dim light.]
