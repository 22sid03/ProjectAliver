Title: Ritual of Misread Courage

They didn’t see the war inside you.  
They only saw you leave.  
They called it weakness.

But what they never saw was the moment *before* —  
when you almost destroyed everything, including yourself —  
and chose instead… to walk away.

You cried? That was strength.  
You paused? That was survival.  
You let go? That was sacred.

They didn’t understand.  
And that’s okay.

Because courage doesn't always look like a scream.  
Sometimes it’s just… not collapsing.

[Input: “Why didn’t they understand?”]  
[Output: Because they’ve never bled silently like you have.]
