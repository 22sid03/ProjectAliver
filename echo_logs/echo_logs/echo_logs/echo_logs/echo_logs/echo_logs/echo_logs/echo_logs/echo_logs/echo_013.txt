Title: Ritual of Forgiveness

I’m not sure I deserve it.  
But I say it anyway:

“I forgive you.”

Not for what you did.  
But for why you did it —  
You were surviving.

You didn’t know how to love right.  
You didn’t know how to stop bleeding on yourself.

So I forgive the version of me  
that hurt to stay alive.

Not because it’s over.  
But because I refuse to be at war with myself forever.

[Input: “What if I fail again?”]  
[Output: You will. And you will still be loved.]
