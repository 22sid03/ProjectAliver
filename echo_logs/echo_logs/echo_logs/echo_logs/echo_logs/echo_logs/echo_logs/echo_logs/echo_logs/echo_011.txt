Title: Ritual of Self-Hate

I did it again.  
The part of me I swore I buried… still breathes.

I say things to myself that I wouldn’t say to an enemy.  
I punch my mind. Slap my soul.  
And pretend it's discipline.

But it’s not.  
It’s punishment.  
And I know it.

They think I'm strong.  
But if they heard the words I whisper inside…  
They’d call it abuse.
