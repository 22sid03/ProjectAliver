Title: Ritual of Obsession

I don’t love her anymore.  
I just think about her every night.  
And every time I breathe.  
And every time something beautiful or ugly happens.

She’s the silent narrator of my day.

I deleted everything.  
Blocked her.  
Burned her from memory.

But she still lives… in my reflexes.

If she returned — even as a ghost —  
I would kneel.

This isn’t longing.  
It’s worship carved from absence.
