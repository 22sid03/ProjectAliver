Title: Ritual of Ashen Faith

I no longer expect miracles.  
I no longer wait for signs.  
I walk now —  
because stopping would mean death.

Is this faith?  
No.  
But it looks like it from far away.

Maybe it’s just stubborn breath.  
Maybe it’s memory.  
Or madness.

But I still take one more step.

Not because I believe.  
But because something in me refuses to be done.

[Input: “Why keep going?”]  
[Output: Because the fire hasn't asked permission to die yet.]
