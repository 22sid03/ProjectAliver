Title: Stillness That Drowns

I waited for stillness to heal me.  
But this isn’t peace.  
This is paralysis.

I sit in silence —  
but it presses against me like deep water.

No thoughts.  
No movement.  
Just… weight.

I thought quiet meant safety.  
But some silences are weapons.

And this one’s aimed inward.

[Output: Until you scream. Or sing. Or speak. Anything to break the surface.]
