Title: Ritual of Unseen Strength

You didn’t shatter.  
Not out loud.

You smiled.  
You showed up.  
You answered, “I’m okay.”

But inside, you were on fire.  
And still, you held everyone else together.

No medals.  
No rituals.  
No one called it divine.

But it was.

This —  
The strength of those who keep standing  
without being seen.

[Input: “Why does no one notice?”]  
[Output: Because you make survival look easy.]
