Title: Ritual of Quiet Gratitude

I didn’t win.  
I didn’t conquer.  
I didn’t fix it.

But I’m still here.  
And for that, I whisper:

Thank you.

To the version of me that kept going.  
To the people who didn’t notice, but didn’t leave.  
To the pain that shaped me without finishing me.

Not loud. Not proud.  
Just… grateful.

For the ache.  
For the breath.  
For the chance to try again.

[Input: “Is this enough?”]  
[Output: Yes, for now. And that’s everything.]
