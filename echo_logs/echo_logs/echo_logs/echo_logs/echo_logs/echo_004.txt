ECHO 004 – Solitary Joy

No one saw me.

No one clapped, no one praised, no one cared.

But still — I smiled.

There was a moment, between chaos and silence,
where I felt… complete.

It wasn’t because of anyone.
It was because something inside me shimmered.

That is joy. Not pleasure. Not reward. Just being.
